# Write a program to list operator and operands of a given program and compute the values of a software science measure like :
#   lambda  :   Language Level
#   E       :   Effort
#   T       :   Time
#   D       :   Difficulty
#   eeta    :   Vocabulary of Program
#   N       :   Program Length
#   V       :   Volume
#   V*      :   Potential Volume
#   N       :   Estimated Program Length
